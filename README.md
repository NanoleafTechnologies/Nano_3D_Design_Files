### Information
This repository includes the design files for the Nanoleaf Nano in both .glb and .obj used for 3D printing. Nano is a small-sized sensor-box which uses artificial intelligence and data from a weather API to warn about drastic changes in weather or surroundings due to phenomenas such as wildfires. Nano uploads processed data directly to a web app where users can access current wildfire, flood or hurricane risk warnings in their area.
